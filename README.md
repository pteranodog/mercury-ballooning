# Project Sunflower
Project Sunflower, created by Team Mercury in the Two-Month program of The University of Alabama in Huntsville's Space Hardware Club, is a proof-of-concept high-altitude balloon payload that uses cold-gas thrusters to face a solar panel toward the sun, allowing for extra power generation to supplement a weight-limited battery life. We believe that this system could be used in the future to allow more scientific experiments to fit on a single balloon, because a lower power storage requirement, and thus fewer batteries, results in a significant portion of the maximum allowed payload weight being free for additional experimental payloads.
